# Arduino

Code for the little devices, and some not so little.

ATTiny85

What's not to like about these little guys?  In an 8 pin DIP, you get:

    1) a microprocessor
    2) clock - no external components needed
    3) 8k ROM
    4) 512 bytes RAM
    5) 512 bytes EEPROM - can be written to in-circuit 
    6) counter/timers
    7) 6 very configurable I/O pins
    8) Analog to digital converters (ADC)
    9) an analog comparator

And the drive current for the pins is 40 ma, with a sleep mode current draw of 
0.24 ua.  For a buck and a half, you can get the Digispark that runs at 16.5 mHz 
and has a USB adapter and a programmable LED.
